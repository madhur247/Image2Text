guide to incorporate into their curriculum. By emphasizing to students the importance
of developing programs to deal with stress, the students may be able to transfer this

Scope of the Study

This study was limited to the perceptions of full-time business employees as to the
negative effects that stress has on work performance and the steps that employers are

operating in the Central Texas area. The Central Texas area encompasses all

affect an individual in the workplace. Data for this study were collected during the fall
of 2002.

Barden (2001), a freelance writer specializing in health care and a former managing
editor of Commerce and Health, stated the importance of wellness programs and gave
specific examples of corporations that are successfully implementing such
programs. The Morrison Company currently saves $8.33 for every dollar spent on
wellness by offering programs such as weight loss, exercise, and back care. Axon
Petroleum estimates that wellness programs will save $1.6 million each year in health
care costs for its 650 employees. In addition to Morrison and Axon Petroleum, Barden

productivity.
