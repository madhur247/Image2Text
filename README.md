# Image2Text
Sem V Mini Project
In the current world, there is a great increase in the utilization of digital technology and various methods are available for the people to capture images. 
Such images may contain important textual data that the user may need to edit or store digitally. 
This can be done using Optical Character Recognition with the help of Tesseract OCR Engine. 
The system will take an image as input which can be of any standard format such as .jpg, .png, etc, which will be then be pre-processed, then passed to the recognizer which will extract the text and output it on our website.
The system will be able to recognize English of different fonts and will be able to convert the hardcopy to softcopy and save time.
